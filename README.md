# Polish Keyboard

Do you also think that standard Windows keyboard just sucks? Do you love your keyboard in Linux Mint/Ubuntu? That package would bring your beloved keyboard into Windows thanks to [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/keyboardlayouts.aspx)!

## Instalation

In `files` directory you'll find some installation packages. Just choose the proper one for your system and run it. Then you'll have to change language settings in your Control Panel and set input source to "Polski (Comandeera)". And that's it – your keyboard just became usable!


## macOS version

There is also version for macOS, in `macOS` directory. Just install [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele), open the file and choose `File`→`Install`→`Intstall for current user`.
